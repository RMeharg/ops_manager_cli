**Before running:** `target` and `login`. You can do this through through config file too.

**config example:** [product_deployment.yml](spec/dummy/product_deployment.yml)

    ./ops_manager deploy-product product_deployment.yml

### Regenerating SSL Certificates

Ops Manager generates certificates for BOSH director and UAA automatically before deploying director.
[Periodically you will want to regenerate this certificates.](https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115000453368)
There is a workaround on how to do this with ops_manager_cli:

1. Get director template:

        $ ops_manager get-director-template > product_installation_settings.yml
  
2. Set director's cert and private key to null:

        # product_installation_settings.yml
        # For director ssl certs
        + director_ssl:
        +   private_key_pem:
        +   cert_pem:

        # For director ssl certs
        + uaa_ssl:
        +   private_key_pem:
        +   cert_pem:

3. Perform director deployment:

        $ ops_manager deploy-product product_deployment.yml

**Note:** remove this lines unless you want to regenerate certs on every single deployment :)

## Using with Docker

The ops_manager_cli tool can be installed in a docker container typically in conjunction with [Concourse CI](http://concourse.ci/).  This allows users to build concourse pipelines to deploy and manage their Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployments.
